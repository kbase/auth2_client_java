# Auth2 client for Java

This repo contains a minimal client for the [KBase Auth2 server](https://github.com/kbase/auth2),
covering only the most common operations - e.g. validating tokens and user names.

Most other uses are easily done with any http/REST client like the built in Java client
in 11+ or the Jersey client.


## Prior version

The prior version of the client is available at https://github.com/kbase/auth.
